# FinGO
Software developed for the Junction Hackathon (Helsinki, Nov 23-25, 2018) by Álvaro Gómez Iñesta and Víctor Gómez Iñesta.

# In a nutshell
Ever had trouble to take your small children shopping? Ever wanted to stay playing at home when your parents wanted to take you shopping as a child? Children and parents are OPPOSITES. Our goal is to BRING THE OPPOSITES CLOSE.

# How it works (user POV)
Before going shopping, parents can specify in FinGO the items they plan to buy, or shops they are interested in. When arriving to the mall, their smartphone will be linked to their children's. Then, an arrow will show a path to the children to find minigames. This arrow will thake the family to one of the items/shops given previously. After that, a cooperative AR-based minigame will pop up in both smartphones. Parent and child will have to work together to solve the puzzle in order to advance to the next item/shop.

# Multidimensional goals
  -Strengthen parental bonds by building a bridge between two commonly OPPOSITE and conflictive activities: shopping and playing.

# Python code
*Some information (e.g. related to wifi devices) used in the project demo must be kept private and therefore there are some holes to fill in the code we post here.
